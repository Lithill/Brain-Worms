## User Experience

### Initial Discussion

There has been a rise in games aimed at improving mental health in recent years. For instance, the [Happify](https://www.happify.com/) app includes a game called Negative Knockout, which lets the user pick negative words they associate with how they are feeling, and proceed to eliminate them in an Angry-Birds-esque game. These games are typically cutesy in style. Brain Worms aims to be a fun version of this type of game for users with a darker sense of humour.

#### Key information for the site

* How to play the game.
* The game itself.

### User Stories

#### Client Goals

* To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
* To have fun whilst feeling more in control of negative feelings.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* To find out how to play the game.
* To be able to play the game on different devices. 

#### Returning Visitor Goals (Stretch Goal)

* To see when I beat my own score.
* To get trophies based on the worms that have been most consistently hit. (I.e. If you always hit fear you get the courage trophy.)

#### Frequent Visitor Goals (Stretch Goal)

* To see the collection of trophies you have won since your first visit.
* To have my score displayed on a leaderboard if I reach the top 10.

## Design

### Early Design Phases

The design was created mobile-first. The first version of the design featured realistic images of a brain and a worm, created by Dall-E 2 and spliced together. It demonstrated that a realistic approach was unsuitable. 

[Early design featuring a realistic brain with a worm emerging from it](assets/images/readme/realistic-brain.JPG)

It was the felt that a pop art style would be more suitable. The phrase “comic book of a side-shot of a human brain" was used to create the following image in Dall-E 2.

![Original Dall-E 2 cartoon brain](assets/images/readme/dall-e-brain1.png)

The rest of the designs started out as the following:

* [“black and white comic book panel frame”](assets/images/readme/frame.png)
* [“comic book panel earthworm with white background” 1](assets/images/readme/worm1.png)
* [variation from first worm - 2](assets/images/readme/worm2.png)
* [variation from first worm - 3](assets/images/readme/worm3.png)
* [variation from first worm - 4](assets/images/readme/worm4.png)
* [variation from first worm - 5](assets/images/readme/worm5.png)
* [variation from first worm - 6](assets/images/readme/worm6.png)

### Colour scheme

The website uses a palette of colours that lends itself to pop-art. This style was chosen in order to contrast the creepiness of brain-eating worms.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Eater is a serif font. This is used for the headings.
* East Sea Dokdo is a sans-serif font. This is used for paragraph text.

### Media

* [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) was used to create all of the artwork.

### Features

The website is comprised of 1 page. This page has the following features:

* Instructions on how to play the game.
* Buttons that start, pause and restart the game.
* Brain Worms whack-a-mole style game.
* Leaderboard.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text, such as footer icons.
* Guaranteeing adequate colour contrast throughout the site.
  
## Wireframes

The Wireframes were made via [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/). This is a mobile-first build.

## Testing

### W3C Validator

### Solved Bugs

1.
	1. Expected behaviour: Initial alert box does not accept any input that isn't a letter
   2. Actual behaviour: Initial alert box accepts ### as a value
   3. Solution: Build in a function that checks for letters only

2.
	1. Expected behaviour: Worm animations always smooth 
   2. Actual behaviour: Sometimes animations stop halfway through the animation and disapear
   3. Solution: Stop the function from animating the same worm twice in a row

3.
	1. Expected behaviour: Worm animations are always visible when requested by the code
   2. Actual behaviour: Sometimes some picked worm animations are skipped, even though they are not repeats of the previous picked worm
   3. Solution: There seemed to be worm gaps because instead of animating, it was toggling off .slide from worms it had previously been applied to. Applying toggle again at the end of the function helped with this. 

4.
	1. Expected behaviour: Worm animations don't have a gap between them
   2. Actual behaviour: Sometimes there was a second gap with no worm animation
   3. Solution: Take out the code that skipped animation if the same worm had been animated previously. Instead insert if statement detailing what to do in this instance, and adding or subtracting from randomWormNumbr before running the animateWorm function. 

5.
	1. Expected behaviour: Players should earn the same amount of points when clicking on worms after restarting the game
   2. Actual behaviour: Players earn extra points when restarting. After clicking restart once, points per click = 2. After clicking restart for a second time during the same session, points per click = 3. 
   3. Solution: I didn't notice when this got fixed, as I think it was linked to something else I fixed. I think the game-run code was duplicating itself rather than stopping and starting again, causing interesting bugs in the process. 

6.
	1. Expected behaviour: Worm animations are smooth and do not blink off.
   2. Actual behaviour: When speed of setInterval increases, some worm animations disapear without running through the whoe animation.
   3. Solution: Add an if statement to see if the chosen worm is currently going through it's animation (e.g. if it has the "switch" class applied to it), and if it is, do not go to the animateWorm function for that setInterval round. 

7.
   1. Expected behaviour: When player finishes game, and presses play again, the game works the same way it did the first time around.
   2. Actual behaviour: When player finishes game, and presses play again, the timer is broken and reads "0:0-1", and there are too many worm animations triggered.
   3. Solution: Reset tickMinutes, tickSeconds and intervalNum before game is played again.

8.
	1. Expected behaviour: When pausing the game and navigating away from the page, everything should be paused still when you come back to the page.
   2. Actual behaviour: When pausing the game and navigating away from the page, the worm animation continues and the timer starts counting down from where it was set. 
   3. Solution: Swap alert boxes for overlays.

9.
	1. Expected behaviour: On iPhone, user isn't given the option to stop the alert boxes popping up. 
   2. Actual behaviour: On iPhone, user is given the option to "supress dialogs", which can break the game.
   3. Solution: Swap alert boxes for overlays.

10.
    1. Expected behaviour: User can't gain more points by multiply clicks per animation.
    2. Actual behaviour: Users can get multiple points by clicking on the same animation.
    3. Solution: Insert click counter and if statement - if clicked once then add point.

11.
    1. Expected behaviour: Player's "You scored x" number is the same across different parts of the page.
    2. Actual behaviour: Player's "You scored x" overlay number can be less than the actual score due to animation still being clickable after the overlay uses the playerScore. 
    3. Solution: setTimeout on game-over overlay.

12.
    1. Expected behaviour: Leaderboard to appear and buttons to unfreeze after game ends.
    2. Actual behaviour: Leaderboard did not appear and buttons did not unfreeze after game ends. 
    3. Solution: Create if statement to check if leaderboardArr is null. 
   
### Known Bugs

   1. Expected behaviour: Worm divs stay over brain picture in different screen sizes
   2. Actual behaviour: Worm divs are not always on brain picture in different screen sizes
   3. Solution: 

   1. Expected behaviour: Worms cannot be seen before animation
   2. Actual behaviour: Worms can sometimes be seen before animation on bigger screen sizes
   3. Solution: 

   1. Expected behaviour: 
   2. Actual behaviour: 
   3. Solution:

### Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the following people who helped me along the way in completing my second milestone project:

- Rimi Hussain for her idea to call it Brain Worms (before the idea included a brain or worms in the design), and to create trophies based on the worms you most consistently hit.
- Chris Mugridge for suggesting I insert an if statement detailing what to do when randomWormNumber is the same as lastWorm, and adding or subtracting from randomWormNumbr before running the animateWorm function. (Instead of skipping the animateWorm function and trying to change the setInterval time for that specific loop around setInterval.)
- My tutor Robert Mclaughlin for helpful feedback and sharing links for further learning.
- My mentor Mitko Bachvarov for helpful feedback and sharing links for further learning.
