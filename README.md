# Brain Worms

This website has been created to offer a Whack-A-Mole style game, where the moles are worms, are they ae inhabiting a brain. It has been designed with a range of different screen sizes in mind.

## User Experience

### Initial Discussion

There has been a rise in games aimed at improving mental health in recent years. For instance, the [Happify](https://www.happify.com/) app includes a game called Negative Knockout, which lets the user pick negative words they associate with how they are feeling, and proceed to eliminate them in an Angry-Birds-esque game. These games are typically cutesy in style. Brain Worms aims to be a fun version of this type of game for users with a darker sense of humour.

#### Key information for the site

* How to play the game.
* The game itself.

### User Stories

#### Client Goals

* To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
* To have fun whilst feeling more in control of negative feelings.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* To find out how to play the game.
* To be able to play the game on different devices. 

#### Returning Visitor Goals (Stretch Goal)

* To see when I beat my own score.
* To get trophies based on the worms that have been most consistently hit. (I.e. If you always hit fear you get the courage trophy.)

#### Frequent Visitor Goals (Stretch Goal)

* To see the collection of trophies you have won since your first visit.
* To have my score displayed on a leaderboard if I reach the top 10.

## Design

### Early Design Phases

The design was created mobile-first. The first version of the design featured realistic images of a brain and a worm, created by Dall-E 2 and spliced together. It demonstrated that a realistic approach was unsuitable. 

[Early design featuring a realistic brain with a worm emerging from it](assets/images/readme/realistic-brain.JPG)

It was the felt that a pop art style would be more suitable. The phrase “comic book of a side-shot of a human brain" was used to create the following image in Dall-E 2.

![Original Dall-E 2 cartoon brain](assets/images/readme/dall-e-brain1.png)

The rest of the designs started out as the following:

* [“black and white comic book panel frame”](assets/images/readme/frame.png)
* [“comic book panel earthworm with white background” 1](assets/images/readme/worm1.png)
* [variation from first worm - 2](assets/images/readme/worm2.png)
* [variation from first worm - 3](assets/images/readme/worm3.png)
* [variation from first worm - 4](assets/images/readme/worm4.png)
* [variation from first worm - 5](assets/images/readme/worm5.png)
* [variation from first worm - 6](assets/images/readme/worm6.png)

### Colour scheme

The website uses a palette of colours that lends itself to pop-art. This style was chosen in order to contrast the creepiness of brain-eating worms.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Eater is a serif font. This is used for the headings.
* East Sea Dokdo is a sans-serif font. This is used for paragraph text.

### Media

* [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) was used to create all of the artwork.

### Features

The website is comprised of 1 page. This page has the following features:

* Instructions on how to play the game.
* Buttons that start, pause and restart the game.
* Brain Worms whack-a-mole style game.
* Leaderboard.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text, such as footer icons.
* Guaranteeing adequate colour contrast throughout the site.
  
## Wireframes

The Wireframes were made via [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/). This is a mobile-first build.

## Testing

### W3C Validator

### Solved Bugs

1.
	1. Expected behaviour: Initial alert box does not accept any input that isn't a letter
   2. Actual bevahiour: Initial alert box accepts ### as a value
   3. Solution: Build in a function that checks for letters only

2.
	1. Expected behaviour: Worm animations always smooth 
   2. Actual bevahiour: Sometimes animations stop halfway through the animation and disapear

```JavaScript
   function pickWorm () {

      const wormArr = ["empty", "fear", "shame", "shyness", "embarrassment", "anxiety", "dread"];

      function animateWormFunction () {  
    
        setInterval(function () {
            let randomWormNumber = generateRandomNum(1, 6); //generates number between 1-6
            let activeWorm = wormArr[randomWormNumber]; //assigns this number to wormArr index
            let activeWormString = "." + activeWorm; //creates class name for worm that has been picked

            //assigns .slide class to the picked worm
            let worm = document.querySelector(activeWormString);//assigning picked worm class

            worm.classList.toggle("slide"); //do I need to toggle this off afterwards?

        }, 1000);
    }
```

   3. Solution: Stop the function from animating the same worm twice in a row

3.
	1. Expected behaviour: Worm animations are always visible when requested by the code
   2. Actual bevahiour: Sometimes some picked worm animations are skipped, even though they are not repeats of the previous picked worm
   3. Solution: Are there worm gaps because it's taking away the class that it previously gave? Or trying to apply a class to one that already has the class, and therefore toggles it off?

### Known Bugs

* Layout has unintended horizontal and verticle scrollbars on desktop view

### Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the following people who helped me along the way in completing my second milestone project:

- Rimi Hussain for her idea to call it Brain Worms (before the idea included a brain or worms in the design), and to create trophies based on the worms you most consistently hit.
- My tutor Robert Mclaughlin for helpful feedback and sharing links for further learning.
- My mentor Mitko Bachvarov for helpful feedback and sharing links for further learning.
